# NCR — New Computational Regime (ISR)

This repository documents the **New Computational Regime (NCR)** based on the **Implicit Superposition Register (ISR)** model.

ISR is a discrete, deterministic computational model whose state is a reduced ordered decision diagram representing an exponentially large set of assignments. Updates apply constraints by symbolic conjunction, without enumerating assignments.

The regime is designed to study **normalization-resistant computation**: systems where standard polynomial normalization techniques fail structurally.

## Model Overview

**ISR = Implicit Superposition Register**

- Symbolic representation of exponential assignment space
- Deterministic constraint conjunction
- No enumeration of assignments
- Polynomial-time operations over implicit state

This repository concerns structural properties only.

## Scope

This repository:
- Documents a computational regime
- Demonstrates normalization resistance structurally

This repository does **not**:
- Claim algorithmic speedups
- Resolve P vs NP
- Assert empirical performance dominance

## Conditional note
- `notes/WITNESS_TIGHTENING_CONDITIONAL_SCOPE_2026_04.md` — conditional note specifying the minimal witness-tightening artifact compatible with current NCR scope.

## Certification Boundary

This repository is **NON-CERTIFIED under URF**.

Only **NEGATIVE certification artifacts** may be present.
No positive NCR claim is asserted.
All results are research or infrastructure-only.

Certification artifacts are declarative, cryptographically signed, and inert with respect to CI and runtime behavior.

## Lean proof portfolio classification

This repository is governed by [`docs/status/LEAN_PROOF_PORTFOLIO_CLASSIFICATION.md`](docs/status/LEAN_PROOF_PORTFOLIO_CLASSIFICATION.md). Its role in the portfolio is explicitly classified as proof-facing, conditional frontier, infrastructure/documentation, or legacy/scaffold.
