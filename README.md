NCR — New Computational Regime

Objective
Exhibit a discrete, reproducible computational regime M that is polynomial-time yet not normalizable into URF-admissible fixed-locality, bounded-transcript refinement models.

Deliverables
1) Formal model definition (docs/MODEL.md)
2) Candidate separation invariant P (docs/INVARIANTS.md)
3) Normalization-failure certificates (examples/)
4) Deterministic verifier scripts (scripts/)
5) CI: deterministic checks (pytest)
