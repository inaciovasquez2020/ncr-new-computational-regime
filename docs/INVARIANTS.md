Invariant Targets

P1: Coherence Rank (global cancellation measure)
P2: Implicit State Dimension (compressed superposition dimension)
P3: Normalization Barrier Property: preserved by URF-admissible refinements, violated by NCR

Goal: prove
forall URF-refinement S: P(S) <= polylog(n)
exists NCR algorithm A: P(A) >= n^alpha
